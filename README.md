Weady is a React app created with the purpose of deepening my client-server architecture and design patterns knowledge.

Structure of the project:

1. Components folder
2. Services folder
3. Backend folder (in this case we do not have backend functionalities)

Project overview and workflow:  
 In the main app.js file, i render the weather card component on initialization, with the weather details based on the current location of the user.  
 The user can then search for another location using the search box.
For every kind of weather, the temperature and the corresponding icon is displayed.
I've made use of Open-Meteo free weather API to get all the weather details, using the API documentation.
